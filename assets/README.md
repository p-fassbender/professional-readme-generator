# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This project was to create a weather dashboard application so that the current weather conditions along with a 5-day future forcast are displayed for a user-searched city. As a traveler I am interested in the weather outlook of multiple city so I can plan my trips accordingly. Working on this project I learned how to fetch information from server-side apis and how to manage and use the recieved data.
